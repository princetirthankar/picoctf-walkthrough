@PW Crack 4

Make This Changes in your Python level4.py code
  1.First take the pos_pw_list list from below to under the import tag 
  2. Add this Code Just after the "def hash_pw(pw_str):"
      ->>def find_pw():
	       		for i in p wos_pw_list:
		      		user_pw = i
		      		user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
		      		if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
			          	return i
         print(find_pw())

         def level_4_pw_check():
#     			user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
     				user_pw_hash = hash_pw(find_pw())

 			   	 if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
      		   	print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
         			decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), find_pw())
         			print(decryption)
         			return
     				print("That password is incorrect")

			
					level_4_pw_check()

What this will do is first travser through every password giving in list and camper it with real password and if matched then it will return that password 
into function called find_pw() then instand of asking for user to enter the password it will directly add that password into user_pw and run the same process 
but now it will return the picoctf flag.

1.Make This Changes in your Python level5.py code

# reading the passwords from dictionary.txt and stroing them into passwords variable
passwords = open("dictionary.txt","r").read()

#using .split creating the pw_into_spilt list file from the passwords
pw_into_split = passwords.split("\n")

#print(pw_into_split)


def find_pw():
	for i in pw_into_split:
		user_pw = i		
		user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
		if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
			print(i)
			return i
find_pw()

def level_5_pw_check():
#    user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    user_pw_hash = hash_pw(find_pw())
    
    if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
        print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
        decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), find_pw())
        print(decryption)
        return
    print("That password is incorrect")
